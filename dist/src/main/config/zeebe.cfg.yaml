# Overview -------------------------------------------

# This file contains a complete list of available configuration options.

# Default values:
#
# When the default value is used for a configuration option, the option is
# commented out. You can learn the default value from this file

# The only deviation from the rule above is the exporters section.
# By default no exporters are configured. This file shows default/example values for configuring
# several exporters. To enable an exporter please uncomment the whole block and overwrite the settings.

# Conventions:
#
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with KB = Kilobytes, MB = Megabytes or GB = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16MB" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified either in the standard ISO-8601 format used
# by java.time.Duration, or as strings with the following format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 5, 10, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the broker.
# ----------------------------------------------------

zeebe-broker:
# Sets the timeout for each start and closing step.
#
# Broker bootstrap and closing is divided in several individual steps.
# Each step should take at max the defined stepTimeout, otherwise the bootstrap is aborted.
#
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_STEPTIMEOUT.
# stepTimeout: 5m

  gateway:
  # Enable the embedded gateway to start on broker startup.
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_ENABLE.
  # enable: true

    network:
    # Sets the host the embedded gateway binds to.
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_NETWORK_HOST.
    # host: 0.0.0.0

    # Sets the port the embedded gateway binds to.
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_NETWORK_PORT.
    # port: 26500

    # Sets the minimum keep alive interval
    # This setting specifies the minimum accepted interval between keep alive pings.
    # This value must be specified as a positive integer followed by 's' for seconds, 'm' for minutes or 'h' for hours.
    # This setting can also be overwritten using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_NETWORK_KEEPALIVEINTERVAL.
    # minKeepAliveInterval: 30s

    cluster:
    # Sets the timeout of requests send to the broker cluster
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_REQUESTTIMEOUT.
    # requestTimeout: 15s

    threads:
    # Sets the number of threads the gateway will use to communicate with the broker cluster
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_MANAGEMENTTHREADS.
    # managementThreads: 1

    monitoring:
    # Enables the metrics collection in the gateway
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_MONITOPRING_ENABLED.
    # enabled: false

    security:
    # Enables TLS authentication between clients and the gateway
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_SECURITY_ENABLED.
    # enabled: false

    # Sets the path to the certificate chain file
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_SECURITY_CERTIFICATECHAINPATH.
    # certificateChainPath:

    # Sets the path to the private key file location
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_GATEWAY_SECURITY_PRIVATEKEYPATH.
    # privateKeyPath:

  network:
  # This section contains the network configuration. Particularly, it allows to
  # configure the hosts and ports the broker should bind to. The broker exposes three sockets:
  # 1. command: the socket which is used for gateway-to-broker communication
  # 2. internal: the socket which is used for broker-to-broker communication
  # 3. monitoring: the socket which is used to monitor the broker

  # Controls the default host the broker should bind to. Can be overwritten on a
  # per binding basis for client, management and replication
  #
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_HOST.
  # host: 0.0.0.0

  # Controls the advertised host; if omitted defaults to the host. This is particularly useful if your
  # broker stands behind a proxy.
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_ADVERTISEDHOST.
  # advertisedHost: 0.0.0.0

  # If a port offset is set it will be added to all ports specified in the config
  # or the default values. This is a shortcut to not always specifying every port.
  #
  # The offset will be added to the second last position of the port, as Zeebe
  # requires multiple ports. As example a portOffset of 5 will increment all ports
  # by 50, i.e. 26500 will become 26550 and so on.
  #
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_PORTOFFSET.
  # portOffset: 0

  # Sets the maximum size of the incoming and outgoing messages (i.e. commands and events).
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_MAXMESSAGESIZE.
  # maxMessageSize: 4MB

    commandApi:
    # Overrides the host used for gateway-to-broker communication
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_COMMANDAPI_HOST.
    # host: localhost

    # Sets the port used for gateway-to-broker communication
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_COMMANDAPI_PORT.
    # port = 26501

    internalApi:
    # Overrides the host used for internal broker-to-broker communication
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_INTERNALAPI_HOST.
    # host: localhost

    # Sets the port used for internal broker-to-broker communication
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_INTERNALAPI_PORT.
    # port: 26502

    monitoringApi:
    # Overrides the host used for exposing monitoring information
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_MONITORINGAPI_HOST.
    # host: localhost

    # Sets the port used for exposing monitoring information
    # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_NETWORK_MONITORINGAPI_PORT.
    # port = 9600

  data:
  # This section allows to configure Zeebe's data storage. Data is stored in
  # "partition folders". A partition folder has the following structure:
  #
  # partition-0                       (root partition folder)
  # ├── partition.json                (metadata about the partition)
  # ├── segments                      (the actual data as segment files)
  # │   ├── 00.data
  # │   └── 01.data
  # └── state                     	(stream processor state and snapshots)
  #     └── stream-processor
  #		  ├── runtime
  #		  └── snapshots

  # Specify a list of directories in which data is stored. Using multiple
  # directories makes sense in case the machine which is running Zeebe has
  # multiple disks which are used in a JBOD (just a bunch of disks) manner. This
  # allows to get greater throughput in combination with a higher io thread count
  # since writes to different disks can potentially be done in parallel.
  #
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_DATA_DIRECTORIES.
  # directories: [ data ]

  # The size of data log segment files.
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_DATA_LOGSEGMENTSIZE.
  # logSegmentSize: 512MB

  # How often we take snapshots of streams (time unit)
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_DATA_SNAPSHOTPERIOD.
  # snapshotPeriod: 15m

  # The maximum number of snapshots kept (must be a positive integer). When this
  # limit is passed the oldest snapshot is deleted.
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_DATA_MAXSNAPSHOTS.
  # maxSnapshots: 3

  cluster:
  # This section contains all cluster related configurations, to setup a zeebe cluster

  # Specifies the unique id of this broker node in a cluster.
  # The id should be between 0 and number of nodes in the cluster (exclusive).
  #
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_CLUSTER_NODEID.
  # nodeId: 0

  # Controls the number of partitions, which should exist in the cluster.
  #
  # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_CLUSTER_PARTITIONSCOUNT.
  # partitionsCount: 1

  # Controls the replication factor, which defines the count of replicas per partition.
  # The replication factor cannot be greater than the number of nodes in the cluster.
  #
  # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_CLUSTER_REPLICATIONFACTOR.
  # replicationFactor: 1

  # Specifies the zeebe cluster size. This value is used to determine which broker
  # is responsible for which partition.
  #
  # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_CLUSTER_CLUSTERSIZE.
  # clusterSize: 1

  # Allows to specify a list of known other nodes to connect to on startup
  # The contact points of the internal network configuration must be specified.
  # The format is [HOST:PORT]
  # Example:
  # initialContactPoints : [ 192.168.1.22:26502, 192.168.1.32:26502 ]
  #
  # To guarantee the cluster can survive network partitions, all nodes must be specified
  # as initial contact points.
  #
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_CLUSTER_INITIALCONTACTPOINTS
  # specifying a comma-separated list of contact points.
  # Default is empty list:
  # initialContactPoints: []

  # Allows to specify a name for the cluster
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_CLUSTER_CLUSTERNAME.
  # Example:
  # clusterName: zeebe-cluster

  threads:
  # Controls the number of non-blocking CPU threads to be used. WARNING: You
  # should never specify a value that is larger than the number of physical cores
  # available. Good practice is to leave 1-2 cores for ioThreads and the operating
  # system (it has to run somewhere). For example, when running Zeebe on a machine
  # which has 4 cores, a good value would be 2.
  #
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_THREADS_CPUTHREADCOUNT
  # cpuThreadCount: 2

  # Controls the number of io threads to be used. These threads are used for
  # workloads that write data to disk. While writing, these threads are blocked
  # which means that they yield the CPU.
  #
  # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBEBROKER_THREADS_IOTHREADCOUNT
  # ioThreadCount: 2

  exporters:
  # Configure exporters below
  #
  # Each exporter should be configured following this template:
  #
  # id:
  #   property should be unique in this configuration file, as it will server as the exporter
  #   ID for loading/unloading.
  # jarPath:
  #   path to the JAR file containing the exporter class. JARs are only loaded once, so you can define
  #   two exporters that point to the same JAR, with the same class or a different one, and use args
  #   to parametrize its instantiation.
  # className:
  #   entry point of the exporter, a class which *must* extend the io.zeebe.exporter.Exporter
  #   interface.
  #
  # A nested table as [exporters.args] will allow you to inject arbitrary arguments into your
  # class through the use of annotations.
  #
