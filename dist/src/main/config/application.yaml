# Zeebe Standalone Broker configuration file (with embedded gateway)

# This file is based on broker.standalone.yaml.template but stripped down to contain only a limited
# set of configuration options. These are a good starting point to get to know Zeebe.
# For advanced configuration options, have a look at the templates in this folder.

# !!! Note that this configuration is not suitable for running a standalone gateway. !!!
# If you want to run a standalone gateway node, please have a look at gateway.yaml.template

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with KB = Kilobytes, MB = Megabytes or GB = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16MB" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified either in the standard ISO-8601 format used
# by java.time.Duration, or as strings with the following format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 5, 10, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the broker.

      # which has 4 cores, a good value would be 2.

    #     Basic authentication for API access. Form-based authentication in the UI. Users and groups are managed in Identity.

    #     OpenID Connect with any compatible Identity Provider (for example, Keycloak, Microsoft EntraID, Okta).
