# Zeebe Standalone Broker configuration file (with embedded gateway)

# This file is based on broker.standalone.yaml.template but stripped down to contain only a limited
# set of configuration options. These are a good starting point to get to know Zeebe.
# For advanced configuration options, have a look at the templates in this folder.

# !!! Note that this configuration is not suitable for running a standalone gateway. !!!
# If you want to run a standalone gateway node, please have a look at gateway.yaml.template

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with KB = Kilobytes, MB = Megabytes or GB = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16MB" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified either in the standard ISO-8601 format used
# by java.time.Duration, or as strings with the following format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 5, 10, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the broker.

  broker:
    gateway:
      # Enable the embedded gateway to start on broker startup.
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_ENABLE.
      enable: true

      network:
        # Sets the port the embedded gateway binds to.
        # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_NETWORK_PORT.
        port: 26500

      security:
        # Enables TLS authentication between clients and the gateway
        # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_SECURITY_ENABLED.
        enabled: false
        authentication:
          # Controls which authentication mode is active, supported modes are 'none' and 'identity'.
          # If 'identity' is set, authentication will be done using camunda-identity, which needs to
          # be configured in the corresponding subsection. See also https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/identity/what-is-identity/ .
          # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_GATEWAY_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_MODE.
          mode: none

    data:
      # Specify a directory in which data is stored.
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_DIRECTORY.
      directory: data
      # The size of data log segment files.
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_LOGSEGMENTSIZE.
      logSegmentSize: 128MB

      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_DATA_SNAPSHOTPERIOD.
      snapshotPeriod: 15m

    cluster:
      # Specifies the Zeebe cluster size.
      # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_CLUSTERSIZE.

      # Controls the replication factor, which defines the count of replicas per partition.
      # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_REPLICATIONFACTOR.
      replicationFactor: 1
      # Controls the number of partitions, which should exist in the cluster.
      # This can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_CLUSTER_PARTITIONSCOUNT.
      partitionsCount: 1

    threads:
      # Controls the number of non-blocking CPU threads to be used.
      # WARNING: You should never specify a value that is larger than the number of physical cores
      # available. Good practice is to leave 1-2 cores for ioThreads and the operating
      # system (it has to run somewhere). For example, when running Zeebe on a machine
      # which has 4 cores, a good value would be 2.
      # This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_BROKER_THREADS_CPUTHREADCOUNT
      cpuThreadCount: 2
      # Controls the number of io threads to be used.
