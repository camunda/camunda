# The actual threading configuration is done via the Reactor properties; these are unfortunately
# not configured via Spring, but rather plain System.properties. Default values (where C is the
# number of available cores, are:
# - [0-2C] for any scheduled tasks, such as the delayed health indicators (default is [0, 10C])
# - [1-max(C, 4)] for the request handling event loop (defaults)
# These are either customized in each `main` (e.g. StandaloneBroker#main) that we have, or are plain
# defaults from the Reactor project.
# Default quiet period is 2s, meaning it waits for the server to be idle for 2 seconds before
# shutting down. This isn't very useful for a management server.
