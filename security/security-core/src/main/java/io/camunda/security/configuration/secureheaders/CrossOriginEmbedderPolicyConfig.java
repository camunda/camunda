/**
 * Configures Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) header for cross-origin isolation.
 *
 * <p>COEP controls whether the document can load cross-origin resources that don't explicitly grant
 * permission. When set to 'require-corp' (default), it requires all cross-origin resources to
 * either: - Include a Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) header allowing the load - Be requested
 * using CORS
 *
 * <p>This header works in conjunction with Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP).
 *
 * <p>Default: REQUIRE_CORP - Requiring explicit opt-in for all cross-origin resources. This may
 * require coordination with third-party services to add appropriate CORP headers.
 *
 * @see <a
