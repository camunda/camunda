/**
 * Configures Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) header for window isolation.
 *
 * <p>COOP allows a website to control whether a new top-level document opened via window.open() or
 * navigation is opened in the same browsing context group (BCG). This provides process isolation
 * between windows, preventing: - Cross-origin access to window.opener - Side-channel attacks like
 * Spectre - Unintended information leakage between windows
 *
 * <p>Default: SAME_ORIGIN_ALLOW_POPUPS - Balances security with compatibility by: - Isolating the
 * window from cross-origin openers - Still allowing popups to be opened (common use case) -
 * Preventing direct DOM access between cross-origin windows
 *
 * <p>Works with COEP to enable "cross-origin isolation" for advanced features.
 *
 * @see <a
