## Architecture

Currently, our structure is separated in something similare to the flow below.

NOTES:
* In the image, BE = backend
* Authentication part is ommited from this diagram

## Build the backend

To build the backend you can use maven:

```
mvn clean install
```

This command runs also all the test suite, that you can skip using the
option `-DskipTests=true`.

## Run modules separately

In case of high load you may need to scale importing of data from Zeebe and archiving of finished instances (this can influence UI performance).
In order to achieve this you can run any of the modules separately: Webapp, Importer and Archiver.

For this you can use following configuration parameters:
* `camunda.operate.webappEnabled`: when `true` will include the Webapp in current run, default: true
* `camunda.operate.clusterNode.partitionIds`: array of Zeebe partition ids, this Importer node must be responsible for, default: empty array, meaning all partitions data is loaded
* `camunda.operate.clusterNode.nodeCount`: total amount of Importer nodes in cluster
* `camunda.operate.clusterNode.currentNodeId`: id of current Importer node, starting from 0

It's enough to configure either `partitionIds` or pair of `nodeCount` and `currentNodeId`.

To further parallelize archiving within one node, following configuration parameter can be used:

## Demo data

There are two sets of data, defined in two different Spring profiles:

- `usertest-data`: data for user tests
- `dev-data`: development data (includes data for user tests plus more)

Ways to activated profiles:

- when running via `make env-up` or `docker-compose`: edit `docker-compose.yml`, section `services.operate.environment` (always leave `dev` profile active)

```text
- SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev,dev-data,auth
```

- when running from distribution via `operate` shell script or `operate.bat`:

```text
JAVA_OPTS=-Dspring.profiles.active=dev-data ./operate
or
JAVA_OPTS=-Dspring.profiles.active=dev-data ./operate.bat
```

## Webapp module

This module contains:
* Internal and Public API REST endpoints
* Operation executor
* Management (Actuator) endpoints: Usage metrics and [Backup API](docs/backup.md)
