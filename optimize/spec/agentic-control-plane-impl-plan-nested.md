# Agentic Control Plane — Implementation Plan (Nested Variant)

**Spec**: `agentic-control-plane-technical-spec.md`

## T-shirt sizes (AI-adjusted)

Estimates assume AI tooling (Claude Code) handles implementation. Human time = guidance, review,
debugging, and running tests against real infrastructure.

| Size | Human effort with AI |
|---|---|
| XS | < 2 hours |
| S | half–1 day |
| M | 1–2 days |
| L | 3–5 days |

## AI Fit ratings

| Rating | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ High | Spec is complete; AI follows existing pattern; generate + light review |
| ⚠️ Medium | Spec is clear but logic is novel; generate + careful review |
| ❌ Low | ES/Painless subtleties, integration infrastructure, or correctness-critical merges; AI helps but human must own |

## Parallelization

Phase 2 endpoints and Phase 3 components are independent — run as many parallel AI agents as
desired after foundation is stable. Do NOT parallelize across phases.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation

Sequential. Everything else depends on these.

| # | Task | Effort | AI Fit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N-0.1 | `AgentInstanceDto` + sub-DTOs (`AgentDefinitionDto`, `AgentMetricsDto`, `AgentToolDto`) | XS | ✅ | Give AI `IncidentDto` as pattern reference; generates in minutes |
| N-0.2 | Add `List<AgentInstanceDto> agentInstances` to `ProcessInstanceDto` | XS | ✅ | One field addition; follows existing `incidents` field pattern |
| N-0.3 | `ProcessInstanceIndex` VERSION 8 → 9: `agentInstances` nested mapping + parent token fields | S | ⚠️ | Give AI the existing `addProperties()` method; critical: `.nested()` vs `.object()` distinction must be correct or ES will auto-map wrong type on first write |

---

## Phase 1 — Import Pipeline

| # | Task | Effort | AI Fit | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N-1.1 | Painless merge + re-aggregation script (`createUpdateAgentInstancesScript()`) | M | ❌ | N-0.2, N-0.3 | **Highest risk task in this variant.** ES Painless has subtle gotchas: `!= null` not `.empty` in update context; `==` vs `.equals()` for String comparison; array mutation semantics. AI will generate plausible-looking but subtly wrong scripts. Must be validated against a real ES instance with all three intents (CREATED → UPDATED → COMPLETED) and verified token totals. |
| N-1.2 | Wire script into `createProcessInstanceUpdateScript()` | XS | ✅ | N-1.1 | One-line append |
| N-1.3 | `ZeebeAgentInstanceFetcher` | XS | ✅ | N-0.1 | Give AI `ZeebeIncidentFetcher` as reference; structural copy |
| N-1.4 | `ZeebeAgentInstanceImportService` | S | ⚠️ | N-0.1, N-0.2, N-1.1 | Give AI `ZeebeIncidentImportService` + spec § 3.3 as reference; review intent-to-timestamp mapping logic (`creationDate` from CREATED, `completionDate` from COMPLETED) |
| N-1.5 | `ZeebeAgentInstanceImportHandler` | XS | ✅ | N-1.3, N-1.4 | Structural copy of existing handler |
| N-1.6 | `ZeebeAgentInstanceImportMediator` + `ZeebeAgentInstanceImportMediatorFactory` | XS | ✅ | N-1.5 | Structural copy of existing mediator/factory pair |
| N-1.7 | Spring registration | XS | ✅ | N-1.6 | Find `ZeebeIncidentImportMediatorFactory` registration; add alongside |
| N-1.8 | Import pipeline integration tests | M | ⚠️ | N-1.4 | AI generates test scaffold; requires real ES + Zeebe infra to run. Verify: metric accumulation across UPDATED events, token totals re-aggregated correctly, COMPLETED sets `completionDate` and `durationInMs`. **Do not skip — Painless bugs only surface here.** |

## Phase 2 — Backend API

All endpoints independent after N-2.1. **Parallelize freely — run all as separate AI agents.**

| # | Task | Effort | AI Fit | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N-2.1 | Controller skeleton + `AgenticControlPlaneFilterParams` | XS | ✅ | N-0.3 | Give AI an existing Optimize controller as reference; generates in minutes |
| N-2.2 | A2 — Agent Dropdown | XS | ✅ | N-2.1 | Spec has exact query; composite scroller pattern already exists |
| N-2.3 | A1 — Process Breakdown | S | ✅ | N-2.1 | Spec has exact query; straightforward terms + nested agg |
| N-2.4 | A3 — Summary KPIs | S | ⚠️ | N-2.1 | WoW parallel query + `medianTokens` Painless percentile; review merge of parallel results |
| N-2.5 | A4 — Token Trend | M | ⚠️ | N-2.1 | Two-step (top-5 then 5 parallel histograms) + "Other" arithmetic; spec is clear but multi-step orchestration needs review |
| N-2.6 | A5 — Duration Stats | S | ✅ | N-2.1 | Spec has exact queries for both L0/L1 and L2; straightforward percentile aggs |
| N-2.7 | A6 — Incident Rate | S | ✅ | N-2.1 | L2 two-nested-agg pattern is clearly specced; no reverse_nested |
| N-2.8 | A8 — Token Outlier Bands | S | ✅ | N-2.1 | Direct Painless percentile on parent-level fields; spec has exact script |
| N-2.9 | A9 — Avg Tokens per Agent Call | XS | ✅ | N-2.1 | `terms` + `bucket_script`; spec has exact query |
| N-2.10 | A10 — Failure Rate by Version | S | ✅ | N-2.1 | Two nested aggs per version bucket; spec clear |
| N-2.11 | A7 — Agents List | M | ⚠️ | N-2.1 | Composite scroller + incident join + merge by `processInstanceId`; pagination correctness must be verified; `successRate = 1 - incidentRate` must be summary-level not per-page |
| N-2.12 | API integration tests | M | ⚠️ | N-2.2 – N-2.11 | AI generates scaffold; requires real infra. Must cover L0/L1/L2 per endpoint, WoW delta, empty state, cursor correctness for A7. **Run before frontend starts.** |

---

## Phase 3 — Frontend

All components independent after N-3.1. **Parallelize freely.**

| # | Task | Effort | AI Fit | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N-3.1 | `AgentFilterContext` + L0/L1/L2 level derivation | S | ⚠️ | — | Give AI existing Optimize filter context as reference; L0/L1/L2 state machine must be correct — everything else branches on it |
| N-3.2 | `ProcessSelector` + `AgentSelector` | XS | ✅ | N-3.1 | Follow existing selector component patterns |
| N-3.3 | `SummaryKPIs` | XS | ✅ | N-3.1 | KPI card component; WoW delta display; `durationScope` label swap |
| N-3.4 | `TokenTrendChart` | S | ⚠️ | N-3.1 | Multi-line vs single-line switch on `elementId`; "Other" series construction; most complex frontend component — review series assembly logic |
| N-3.5 | `TokenOutlierBands` | XS | ✅ | N-3.1 | p5/p50/p95 area chart |
| N-3.6 | `AvgTokensPerAgentCall` | XS | ✅ | N-3.1 | Bar chart; L1/L2 visibility guard |
| N-3.7 | `DurationStats` | XS | ✅ | N-3.1 | Two KPI cards + trend line; label/tooltip swap |
| N-3.8 | `IncidentRateKPI` | XS | ✅ | N-3.1 | |
| N-3.9 | `FailureRateByVersion` | XS | ✅ | N-3.1 | Bar chart; L1/L2 visibility guard |
| N-3.10 | `AgentsList` | S | ⚠️ | N-3.1 | `search_after` cursor pagination ("load more"); summary-level stats header; no per-row badge |
| N-3.11 | `ControlPlaneDashboard` — layout + visibility matrix | S | ✅ | N-3.2 – N-3.10 | Wires context → conditional chart rendering per L0/L1/L2 |
| N-3.12 | Frontend integration / E2E tests | L | ⚠️ | N-3.11 | AI generates scaffold; requires running backend. Golden path per filter level; empty state; WoW delta; cursor pagination. |

## Summary (AI-adjusted)

| Phase | Effort | Critical path item |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | ~1 day | N-0.3 (index mapping — `.nested()` vs `.object()` correctness) |
| Phase 1 | ~1 week | N-1.1 (Painless script — verify against real ES), N-1.8 (integration tests) |
| Phase 2 | ~1.5 weeks | N-2.5 (Token Trend orchestration), N-2.11 (Agents List pagination) |
| Phase 3 | ~1 week | N-3.4 (Token Trend chart), N-3.12 (E2E tests) |
| **Total** | **~4 weeks** | |

**Critical path**: N-0.3 → N-1.1 *(human validation required)* → N-1.8 *(infra)* → N-2.1 → [parallel endpoints] → N-2.12 *(infra)* → N-3.1 → [parallel components] → N-3.12

**Highest-risk tasks requiring human ownership** (AI output insufficient alone):
1. **N-1.1** — Painless script correctness; test on real ES before wiring
2. **N-1.8** — Integration tests; only place Painless bugs surface
3. **N-2.11** — Agents List pagination + merge; pagination bugs are subtle
4. **N-2.12** — API integration tests; cross-level filter coverage
