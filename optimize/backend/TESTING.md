# Testing

There are three kinds of tests in the backend:

* [Unit tests](#unit-testing)
* [Integration tests](#integration-testing)
* [Performance tests](#performance-testing)

## Prerequisites

* You need to have a recent version of Docker and `docker-compose` installed.
* `docker` and `docker-compose` commands must be usable without `sudo`. See [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) how to archieve that.

## Unit testing

Run the following command to run the unit tests:

```
mvn clean test
```

All the unit tests are contained in the [src/test](./src/test/java/.) folder.
To write your own unit test, just add the springrunner class and the respective application context like this:

```java
@ContextConfiguration(locations = {"/unit/applicationContext.xml"})
public class YourCustomUnitTest {

    // example Optimize bean creation
    @Autowired
    private ConfigurationService configurationService;

    // do you testing here ...

}
```

The spring context enables you to instantiate an object of each class used in Optimize.

## Integration testing

This project has integration tests implemented that rely on following facts:

* tomcat is with engine, engine-rest and engine-it-plugin modules is started and is listening to port 8080
  for HTTP requests
* elasticsearch is started and is listening to port 9300 for TCP connections, as well as as port 9200
  for HTTP connections
* build is performed with ```it``` profile

in order to debug your test locally you have the following options:

* [run all integration tests via maven](#run-all-tests)
* [setup environment and run tests manually](#run-tests-manually)

### Run all tests

If you just want to run all tests in one command without making additional
efforts, just run the following:

```
mvn -Pit clean verify
```

Elasticsearch and the engine are setup automatically through Docker.

### Run tests in parallel

Given a powerful machine, tests can be run concurrently using test process forks locally.
In order to fork multiple test processes the `test.forkCount` jvm property can be provided.

E.g. for running 2 tests processes in parallel do:

```
mvn -Pit clean verify -Dtest.forkCount=2
```

### Run tests manually

Especially, if you want to debug a test, it can make sense to setup the
environment manually to step through a failing test case.

Start Tomcat with the engine deployed and Elasticsearch together using the following cmdline:

```
mvn -Pit pre-integration-test
```

This basically spins up the integration test environment using Docker. Now you should be able to run your tests in your preferred IDE.

### Writing your own test

All the integration tests are contained in the [src/it](./src/it/java/.) folder.

To write your own integration test, there are three extensions/rules to help you setting up the environment and interacting with it:

* **engineIntegrationExtension**: Cleans up the engine after each test and allows for interaction with/population of data to the engine using the rest api.
* **embeddedOptimizeExtension**: Starts Optimize, ensures that the configuration is always reset, allows direct interaction with Optimize components.
* **databaseIntegrationTestExtension**: Cleans up Elasticsearch after each test, allows interaction with, populating data to Elasticsearch.

These can be used by extending the `AbstractIT` class.

In addition to the rules, you need to add the the springrunner class and the respective application context to your test class. The following shows an example template for a test class:

```java
@ContextConfiguration(locations = {"/it/it-applicationContext.xml"})
public class YourCustomIT  {

  @RegisterExtension
  @Order(1)
  public DatabaseIntegrationTestExtension databaseSearchIntegrationTestExtension = new DatabaseIntegrationTestExtension();
  @RegisterExtension
  @Order(2)
  public EngineIntegrationExtension engineIntegrationExtension = new EngineIntegrationExtension();
  @RegisterExtension
  @Order(3)
  public EmbeddedOptimizeExtension embeddedOptimizeExtension = new EmbeddedOptimizeExtension();

  @Test
  public void myFirstCustomTest() {
    // write your test here...
  }
}

  // write more tests here...
```

Note, that there are two kind of integration tests:

* Backend end to end test: Data is added to the engine, imported to Optimize and a query executed. Therefore, all three rules are needed.
* Rest service tests: The idea is just to test the rest endpoint. Data is added to elasticsearch manually, a rest request is performed against Optimize and the result validated. Therefore, only the *EmbeddedOptimizeRule* and the *ElasticSearchIntegrationTestRule* are needed here. Also use the application context */it/it-applicationContext.xml* for this kind of tests.

### Working with snapshots

While executing integration tests it might be useful snapshots of data from elasticsearch. Please refer to [wiki](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-optimize/wiki/Using-ES-snapshots) for more information.
