#!/bin/bash -eu
# Verifies certain properties of the Docker image, e.g. actualLabels are correct. This script relies
# on `jq` as an external dependency.
#
# Example usage:
#   $ ./verify.sh camunda/optimize:8.6.0 registry.camunda.cloud/team-optimize/optimize:8-latest
#
# Globals:
#   VERSION - required; the semantic version, e.g. 8.6.0 or 8.6.0-alpha1
#   REVISION - required; the sha1 of the commit used to build the artifact
#   DATE - required; the ISO 8601 date at which the image was built
#   BASE_IMAGE - required; Docker base image name (e.g. docker.io/library/alpine:3.20.0)
# Arguments:
#   1 - Docker image names to be checked (no limit on number of images, each is checked separately)
# Outputs:
#   STDERR Error message if any of the properties are invalid
# Returns:
#   0 on success
#   1 if one of the properties is invalid
