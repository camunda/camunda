# Contributing to Zeebe

## Building Zeebe from source

Zeebe is developed as multi module maven project. To build all components
run the command `mvn clean install -DskipTests` in the root folder.

The resulting Zeebe distribution can be found in the folder `dist/target`, i.e.
```
dist/target/zeebe-distribution-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
dist/target/zeebe-distribution-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.zip
```

This is a small overview of the contents of the different modules:
- `util` contains custom implementations of building blocks like an actor scheduler, buffer allocations, metrics. Its parts are used in most of the other modules
- `protocol` contains the SBE definition of the main message protocol
- `bpmn-model` is a Java API for BPMN process definitions used for parsing etc.
- `msgpack-*` is custom msgpack implementation with extensions to evaluate json-path expressions on msgpack objects
- `dispatcher` is a custom implementation of message passing between threads
- `service-container` is a custom implementation to manage dependencies between different services
- `logstreams` is an implementation of a append only log backed by the filesystem
- `transport` is our abstraction over network transports
- `gossip` is a cluster membership and failure detection implementation
- `raft` is a cluster consensus and replication implementation
- `broker-core` contains the Zeebe broker which is the server side of Zeebe
- `client-java` contains the Java Zeebe client

## Building the Documentation

The documentation is located in the folder `docs`. In order to build the
documentation you need the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/releases) utilitity.

After this run the command `mdbook serve` in the `docs` folder. It will build
the documentation on every change and make it accessible under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Reporting issues or contact developers

Zeebe uses GitHub issues to organize the development process. If you want to
report a bug or request a new feature feel free to open a new issue on
[GitHub][issues].

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by
providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small
[sample project][sample] that reproduces the problem.

If you have a general usage question please ask on the [forum][] or [slack][] channel.

## Work on an issue

The Zeebe follows a
[gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) workflow.
The `develop` branch contains the current in development state of the project,
where the `master` branch contains the latest stable release.

If you want to work on an issue please follow the following steps:

1. Check that a [GitHub issue][issues] exists for the task you want to work on,
   if not please create one first and have a look at the [issue
   guidelines](#github-issue-guidelines).
1. Checkout the `develop` branch and pull the latest changes.
   ```
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   ```
1. Create a new branch with the naming scheme `issueId-description`.
   ```
   git checkout -b 123-adding-bpel-support`
   ```
1. Implement the required changes on your branch and regularly push your
   changes to the origin so that the CI can run on it. Git commit will run a
   pre-commit hook which will check the formatting, style and license headers
   before committing. If these checks fail please fix the issues. Code format
   and license headers can be fixed automatically by running maven. Checkstyle
   violations have to be fixed manually.
   ```
   git commit -am 'feat(broker): bpel support'
   git push -u origin 123-adding-bpel-support
   ```
1. If you think you finished the issue please prepare the branch for reviewing.
   In general the commits should be squashed into meaningful commits with a
   helpful message. This means cleanup/fix etc commits should be squashed into
   the related commit. If you made refactorings or similar which are not
   directly necessary for the task it would be best if they are split up into
   another commit. Rule of thumb is that you should think about how a reviewer
   can best understand your changes. Please follow the [commit message
   guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).
1. After finishing up the squashing force push your changes to your branch.
   ```
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```
1. To start the review process create a new pull request on GitHub from your
   branch to the `develop` branch. Give it a meaningful name and describe
   your changes in the body of the pull request. Lastly add a link to the issue
   this pull request closes, i.e. by writing in the description `closes #123`
1. Assign the pull request to one developer to review, if you are not sure who
   should review the issue skip this step. Someone will assign a reviewer for
   you.
1. The reviewer will look at the pull request in the following days and give
   you either feedback or accept the changes.
    1. If there are changes requested address them in a new commit. Notify the
       reviewer in a comment if the pull request is ready for review again. If
       the changes are accepted squash them again in the related commit and force push.
       Then initiate a merge by writing a comment with the contet `bors r+`.
    1. If no changes are requested the reviewer will initiate a merge by adding a
       comment with the content `bors r+`.
1. When a merge is initiated, a bot will merge your branch with the latest
   develop and run the CI on it.
    1. If everything goes well the branch is merged and deleted and the issue
       and pull request are cloesed.
    2. If there are merge conflicts the author of the pull request has to
       manually rebase `develop` into the issue branch and retrigger a merge
       attempt.
    3. If there are CI errors the author of the pull request has to check if
       they are caused by its changes and address them. If they are flaky tests
       a merge can be retried with a comment with the content `bors retry`.

## GitHub Issue Guidelines

Every issue should have a meaningful name and a description which either
describes:
- a new feature with details about the use case the feature would solve or
  improve
- a problem, how we can reproduce it and what would be the expected behavior
- a change and the intention how this would improve the system

### Labels

Every issue will have up to three types of labels to indicate its status, type
  and scope. The status label will be normally managed by https://waffle.io/zeebe-io/zeebe.

- [[:mag:]][status] Status:
  - No status label means it is not planned to work on the issue in the
    near future
  - [[:mag:]][planned] **Planned**: We plan to work on the issue in the current quarter
  - [[:mag:]][ready] **Ready**: We plan to work on the issue in the next weeks
  - [[:mag:]][in progress] **In Progress**: Someone is currently actively working on the issue
  - [[:mag:]][needs review] **Needs Review**: The initial work on the issue is finished and it is now
    subject to the review process
- [[:mag:]][type] Type:
  - [[:mag:]][enhancement] **Enhancement**: A user facing feature or improvement, decided if this
  - [[:mag:]][bug] **Bug**: A user facing bug fix, which will be listed in the changelog
    issue is something with should be listed in the changelog
  - [[:mag:]][maintenance] **Maintenance**: A non-user facing code change
  - [[:mag:]][docs] **Docs**: A addition or change to the docs
  - [[:mag:]][question] **Question**: A general question which not yet is an actionable issue
- [[:mag:]][scope] Scope:
  - No scope label means it is not directly related to a code change in either
    the broker or client
  - [[:mag:]][broker] **broker**: Issues related to code changes which involve the server part
    of the architecture, including gateway and exporters
  - [[:mag:]][clients/java] **clients/java**: Issues related to code changes which involve the java
    client
  - [[:mag:]][clients/go] **clients/go**: Issues related to code changes which involve the go
    client and zbctl

## Commit Message Guidelines

The commit message should match the following pattern
```
%{type}(%{scope}): %{description}
```

- `type` and `scope` should be chosen as follows
    - `feat`: For user facing features or improvements. `scope` should be either
      `broker`, `clients/java` or `clients/go`.
    - `fix`: For user facing bug fixes. `scope` should be either
      `broker`, `clients/java` or `clients/go`.
    - `chore`: For code changes which are not user facing, `scope` should be
      the folder name of the component which contains the main part of the
      change, e.g. `broker-core` or `exporters`.
    - `docs`:  For changes on the documentation. `scope` should be the sub folder
      name in the `docs/src/` directory which contains the main change, e.g.
      `introduction` or `reference`.
- `description`: short description of the change to a max length of the whole
  subject line of 120 characters

Zeebe uses a bot which will check your commit messages when a pull request is
submitted. Please make sure to address any hints from the bot.
