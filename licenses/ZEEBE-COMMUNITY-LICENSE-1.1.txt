Zeebe Community License v1.1

This Zeebe Community License v1.1 ("this Agreement") sets forth the terms and
conditions on which Camunda Services GmbH ("the Licensor") makes available this
software ("the Software"). BY INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING, USING OR
DISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE TO, AND ARE ENTERING
INTO A CONTRACT WITH, THE LICENSOR ON THE TERMS SET OUT IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF
YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU ARE
RECEIVING THE SOFTWARE ON BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT
THAT YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL AUTHORITY TO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF SUCH ENTITY. "Licensee" means you, an individual, or the
entity on whose behalf you are receiving the Software.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to the Licensee obtaining a copy
of this Software and associated documentation files, to deal in the Software
without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy,
modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the
Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,
subject in each case to the following conditions:

Condition 1: If the Licensee distributes the Software or any derivative works
of the Software, the Licensee must attach this Agreement.

Condition 2: Without limiting other conditions in this Agreement, the grant of
rights under this Agreement does not include the right to provide a Commercial
Process Automation Service.

A "Commercial Process Automation Service" is a service intended for or directed
towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation for the provider of the
service enabling third parties (other than the provider’s employees or
Contractors) to deploy and execute Custom Processes or to access the Software
via its APIs.

"Contractors" means third parties who are engaged to perform ICT development,
maintenance, configuration, training, consulting or associated management
services and are acting in that capacity.

"Custom Processes" means process descriptions contained in BPMN or similar
configuration files, that specify the logic for executing programmatic
services, such that third parties can define these programmatic services freely
(as opposed to selecting them from a restricted set of pre-defined programmatic
services made available by the provider of the Commercial Process Automation
Service).

If the Licensee is in breach of the Conditions, this Agreement, including the
rights granted under it, will automatically terminate with immediate effect.

SUBJECT AS SET OUT BELOW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO
EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES
OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUDES OR RESTRICTS A PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR (A)
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THAT PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE, (B) FRAUD, OR (C)
ANY OTHER LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CANNOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR
RESTRICTED.
