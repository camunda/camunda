    # The following overwrites an "internal" annotation (one that the user
    # should not interfere with as it is not documented in the README at
    # https://github.com/mittwald/kubernetes-replicator/). We do this anyways to
    # force replicator-tool to replicate the contents of this secret again.
    # This is necessary as we have to set empty default data fields to create a
    # valid `type: kubernetes.io/tls` secret but this will purge the previously
    # replicated contents.
