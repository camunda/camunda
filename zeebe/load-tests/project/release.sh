# Usage: ./release.sh [-p] VERSION
# Example usage:
#   $ ./release.sh 1.2.4
# This script will build the Docker images for the worker and starter applications in this project,
# for the given version. The `VERSION` should be the semantic version, and match the tag that you
# want to build. The script will checkout that tag in a temporary worktree, and run the docker
# commands from that worktree.
#
# By default, the script is interactive, and it will ask the user whether or not to push the images.
# You can specify the `-p` flag to automatically push, or the environment variable PUSH=1, e.g.:
#   $ ./release.sh -p 1.2.4
