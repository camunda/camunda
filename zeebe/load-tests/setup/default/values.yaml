# Default values for Zeebe Benchmark Helm chart.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# The values file follows helm best practices https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/
#
# This means:
#   * Variable names should begin with a lowercase letter, and words should be separated with camelcase.
#   * Every defined property in values.yaml should be documented. The documentation string should begin with the name of the property that it describes, and then give at least a one-sentence description
#
# Furthermore, we try to apply the following pattern: # [VarName] [conjunction] [definition]
#
# VarName:
#
#  * In the documentation the variable name is started with a big letter, similar to kubernetes resource documentation.
#  * If the variable is part of a subsection/object we use a json path expression (to make it more clear where the variable belongs to).
#    The root (chart name) is omitted (e.g. zeebe). This is useful for using --set in helm.
#
# Conjunction:
#   * [defines] for mandatory configuration
#   * [can be used] for optional configuration
#   * [if true] for toggles
#   * [configuration] for section/group of variables
