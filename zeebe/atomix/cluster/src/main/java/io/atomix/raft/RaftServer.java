/**
 * Provides a standalone implementation of the <a href="http://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus
 * algorithm</a>.
 *
 * <p>To create a new server, use the server {@link RaftServer.Builder}. Servers require cluster
 * membership information in order to perform communication. Each server must be provided a local
 * {@link MemberId} to which to bind the internal {@link io.atomix.raft.protocol.RaftServerProtocol}
 * and a set of addresses for other members in the cluster.
 *
 * <h2>State machines</h2>
 *
 * State machines are provided in a factory to allow servers to transition between stateful and
 * stateless states.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Address address = new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000);
 * Collection<Address> members = Arrays.asList(new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000), new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000));
 *
 * RaftServer server = RaftServer.builder(address)
 *   .withStateMachine(MyStateMachine::new)
 *   .build();
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Raft relies upon determinism to ensure consistency throughout the cluster, so <em>it is
 * imperative that each server in a cluster have the same state machine with the same commands.</em>
 * State machines are provided to the server as a {@link Supplier factory} to allow servers to
 * {@link RaftMember#promote(RaftMember.Type) transition} between stateful and stateless states.
 *
 * <h2>Storage</h2>
 *
 * By default, the log is stored on disk, but users can override the default {@link RaftStorage}
 * configuration via {@link RaftServer.Builder#withStorage(RaftStorage)}.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * RaftServer server = RaftServer.builder(address)
 *   .withStateMachine(MyStateMachine::new)
 *   .withStorage(Storage.builder()
 *     .withDirectory(new File("logs"))
 *     .build())
 *   .build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Servers use the {@code Storage} object to manage the storage of cluster configurations, voting
 * information, and state machine snapshots in addition to logs. See the {@link RaftStorage}
 * documentation for more information.
 *
 * <h2>Bootstrapping the cluster</h2>
 *
 * Once a server has been built, it must be {@link #bootstrap() bootstrapped} to form a new cluster.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * CompletableFuture<RaftServer> future = server.bootstrap();
 * future.thenRun(() -> {
 *   System.out.println("Server bootstrapped!");
 * });
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Alternatively, the bootstrapped cluster can include multiple servers by providing an initial
 * configuration to the {@link #bootstrap(MemberId...)} method on each server. When bootstrapping a
 * multi-node cluster, the bootstrap configuration must be identical on all servers for safety.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<Address> cluster = Arrays.asList(
 *   new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000),
 *   new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000),
 *   new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000)
 * );
 *
 * CompletableFuture<RaftServer> future = server.bootstrap(cluster);
 * future.thenRun(() -> {
 *   System.out.println("Cluster bootstrapped");
 * });
 *
 * }</pre>
