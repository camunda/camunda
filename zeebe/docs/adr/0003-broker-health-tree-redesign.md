# Broker health tree: nest physical tenants, project metrics, drop intrinsic health

**DRI**: Lena Schönburg

**Status**: Proposed (8.10)

**Purpose**: Restructure the broker health tree so physical tenants are a real structural level,
metrics are a projection of the tree rather than a parallel graph, and a partition's own health
factors are explicit child nodes instead of a bundled "intrinsic health" object.

**Audience**: Zeebe broker engineers and AI agents working on health monitoring, partition
lifecycle, or the `zeebe_broker_health_nodes` metric.

## Context

The broker tracks its health by aggregating components into a tree: a node is healthy only if all of
its children are healthy, and the tree is exported as the `zeebe_broker_health_nodes` metric so it
can be drawn in Grafana. The full mechanics are described in
[docs/zeebe/health.md](../../../docs/zeebe/health.md); this section reproduces the shape the ADR
changes so the before/after can be compared in one place.

### The current tree

```
BrokerHealthCheckService
  └─ CCHM "Broker-<id>"
       ├─ ZeebePartition (wrapper) "Partition-<tenant>-<n>" ─┐ two objects,
       │    └─ CCHM                "Partition-<tenant>-<n>" ─┘ same name → node emitted twice
       │         ├─ RaftPartition
       │         ├─ StreamProcessor
       │         ├─ ExporterDirector
       │         ├─ SnapshotDirector
       │         ├─ MigrationSnapshotDirector
       │         └─ ZeebePartitionHealth-<n>  ← phantom node: bundles disk + transition + dead
       └─ ... every partition of every tenant on one flat level (no tenant grouping)
```

On top of this, the metric export is a **second graph**: `HealthTreeMetrics` keeps its own
relationship/meter maps in sync with the tree via listener callbacks, and a CCHM emits nodes as a
side effect of aggregating. Because a Micrometer listener's tags are fixed per instance, there are
two exporters bound to two registries — broker-global (`physicalTenant=none`) and partition-scoped
(the real tenant/partition tags). The partition node sits on the boundary between them and is emitted
by both.

### Why this is bad

The specific symptoms above all trace back to four structural mistakes:

- **The export structure is a parallel copy instead of a projection of the source of truth.** The
  metric graph is hand-synchronised with the aggregation tree, so the two can drift, and a node that
  straddles the two exporters (the partition) is reported twice with different tags. Anything derived
  from a model should be *computed from* that model, not maintained alongside it.
- **Identity is a global string, so names carry structural information.** Keying every node by a
  globally-unique `componentName` forces the tenant into the partition's name purely to avoid map
  collisions (`Partition-<tenant>-<n>`). The name ends up encoding *where* a node sits, which is the
  tree's job, not the name's.
- **A node cannot express its own health, only its children's.** A CCHM is healthy iff its children
  are, with no notion of the node itself being unhealthy. To inject a partition's own health (disk,
  transition state, death) it is wrapped in a fake child node, `ZeebePartitionHealth-<n>`, that
  corresponds to no real subsystem and bundles three unrelated facts behind one opaque gauge.
- **The domain hierarchy is not represented structurally.** Physical tenants are a real level of the
  system, but the tree is flat — every tenant's partitions hang directly off the broker — so the
  tenant has to be smuggled into strings rather than being a node you can aggregate and filter on.

### What would be better

The same four points, inverted, are the principles the decision applies:

- **One tree is the source of truth; metrics are a pure projection of it.** Emitting is derived from
  the tree, computed from each node's position, so it cannot drift and cannot double-count.
- **Identity is the object and its position; names are for display only** and need be unique only
  among siblings — so structural facts (tenant, partition number) live in the tree, not in names.
- **A health node is either an aggregator or a leaf, with nothing bundled or hidden.** A node's own
  health factors are themselves first-class leaf nodes, so the tree explains *why* something is
  unhealthy instead of hiding it behind a synthetic component.
- **The tree mirrors the domain.** Physical tenant is a structural level between broker and
  partition, so it can be aggregated, filtered, and reasoned about like any other node.

Separately — and already correct — **broker readiness** (`BrokerHealthCheckService.isBrokerReady()`)
is independent of the health tree. It is gated on every configured physical tenant having registered
its bootstrap partitions and every such partition having installed, upholding the invariant that
**the broker does not become ready until partitions from all physical tenants have started**. This
ADR does not change readiness.

## Decision

Apply the four principles above. The target tree has every interior node a plain CCHM and every leaf
a plain `HealthMonitorable`:

```
Broker-<id>                         CCHM
  └─ Tenant-<tenant>                CCHM, one per physical tenant
       └─ Partition-<n>             CCHM   (no tenant prefix)
            ├─ RaftPartition        leaf
            ├─ StreamProcessor      leaf   (registered/removed per role transition)
            ├─ ExporterDirector     leaf   (registered/removed per role transition)
            ├─ SnapshotDirector     leaf   (registered/removed per role transition)
            ├─ MigrationSnapshotDirector  leaf (registered/removed per role transition)
            ├─ DiskSpace            leaf   (diskSpaceAvailable)
            └─ PartitionTransition  leaf   (servicesInstalled + getHealthIssue + sticky-dead)
```

**D1. Physical tenant is a structural level.** Insert a tenant-level CCHM between the broker CCHM
and the partition CCHMs. The broker CCHM aggregates tenant CCHMs; each tenant CCHM aggregates its
partition CCHMs. Tenant nodes are created eagerly for every *expected* physical tenant (the set is
known from configuration at construction) and removed only at shutdown, so the tree is complete and
predictable and an empty-but-expected tenant is legitimately not-yet-healthy. Cross-actor upward
propagation already works (partition → broker today); partition → tenant → broker is the same
mechanism with one more hop, with tenant CCHMs running on the broker health actor.

**D2. Node identity is the object and its position, not a global name.** A node's identity is the
object; its path is derived by walking parents; its display name need only be unique **among
siblings**. `Partition-1` under tenant A and under tenant B are distinct nodes by position. Sibling
maps (`Map<childKey, node>`) replace the global string maps. This removes the reason for the tenant
prefix: `ZeebePartition.componentName` reverts to `Partition-<n>`, undoing the qualification added in
commit `b50ce17`.

**D3. Metric emission is a projection of the health tree, owned by a single projector, decoupled
from CCHM.** CCHM no longer calls a `ComponentTreeListener`; it becomes a pure aggregator. A single
projector observes node add/remove on the real tree and emits exactly one `zeebe_broker_health_nodes`
gauge per node, deriving both the `path` and the `physicalTenant`/`partition` tags from the node's
position (its `Tenant` and `Partition` ancestors). Consequences: there is one node object per node,
so double emission is structurally impossible; the two-exporters/two-registries split and the
fixed-`extraTags` hack are gone; and CCHM loses code rather than gaining it.

**D4. A partition contributes exactly one node.** The `ZeebePartition` wrapper/inner-CCHM double
identity is removed. `ZeebePartition` owns and registers a single partition CCHM under its tenant
node; it is no longer itself a tree node, and the `getHealthReport()` delegation hop disappears.

**D5. A partition's own health factors are explicit child leaves; there is no "intrinsic health"
concept.** `ZeebePartitionHealth` is deleted and its signals become ordinary `HealthMonitorable`
leaf children of the partition CCHM, grouped by concern:

- **`DiskSpace`** — reflects `diskSpaceAvailable`. Starts healthy (assume available until told
  otherwise).
- **`PartitionTransition`** — reflects the role-transition lifecycle: `servicesInstalled`, the live
  `partitionTransition.getHealthIssue()`, and the sticky `dead` latch from `onUnrecoverableFailure`
  (these three are one concern). Starts unhealthy ("services not installed").

The setters retarget from the deleted class to these leaves; they register in `onActorStarted` and
unregister on close, exactly as `ZeebePartitionHealth` does today, preserving current default states.
CCHM stays a pure aggregator — no subclass, no protected hook, no wrapper. The **dead latch lives on
the `PartitionTransition` leaf**, not on CCHM: a `DEAD` child makes the partition CCHM report `DEAD`
under the existing worst-wins aggregation, which propagates up the tree. ("Once dead, stays dead" is
a property of that one leaf. `handleUnrecoverableFailure` continues to also notify failure listeners
directly and stop the partition; the leaf's dead state merely makes the tree consistent with that.)

**D6. Readiness stays separate from the health tree.** `isBrokerReady()` continues to be derived
from the expected-tenants and partition-install bookkeeping, not from tree health, because a
transiently-unhealthy but installed partition must not un-ready the broker. The "all physical tenants
must have started" invariant is unchanged.

## Alternatives considered

- **Rewrite the metric `path` string to look nested (cosmetic).** Transform `Partition-<tenant>-<n>`
  into `Broker/<tenant>/Partition-<n>` in the exporter only. Rejected: it changes the displayed path
  without changing the structure, leaving the flat map, the double emission, and the phantom health
  node in place.
- **Keep the tenant prefix in the partition name (status quo, `b50ce17`).** Rejected: the prefix is a
  workaround for a global flat map. With sibling-scoped identity (D2) the collision it guards against
  cannot occur, and the name stops carrying structural information.
- **Fold intrinsic health into a CCHM subclass via a protected `combineWithSelf` hook, or into a
  composed `HealthMonitor` wrapping a CCHM.** Both add machinery — a new concept on shared
  infrastructure, or delegation boilerplate plus a wrapper that (without D3) reintroduces the
  double-node. Rejected in favour of D5: explicit child leaves need *no* new concept, keep CCHM a
  pure aggregator, and are strictly more observable (a `DiskSpace` gauge and a `PartitionTransition`
  gauge instead of one opaque `ZeebePartitionHealth` gauge).
- **Implement the partition node as a `HealthMonitor` with no CCHM at all.** Rejected: the partition
  has runtime-changing children that must be aggregated thread-safely (the child map, per-child
  failure subscription, periodic re-probe, and remove-race handling). That machinery *is* CCHM;
  avoiding it means reimplementing the exact races CCHM already handles.
- **Split `servicesInstalled` and `getHealthIssue` into separate leaves.** Rejected as YAGNI: they
  are one lifecycle concern and `getHealthIssue` already originates in the transition. Keep them in
  the single `PartitionTransition` leaf.
- **Fold readiness into the health tree.** Rejected (D6): readiness and health answer different
  questions, and coupling them would let a transient health blip un-ready the broker.
- **A generic N-level tree/graph framework with pluggable export.** Rejected as over-engineering. The
  domain has exactly three interior levels (broker, tenant, partition) plus leaves; hard-code that.

## Consequences

- The tree matches the domain: `Broker → Tenant → Partition → leaves`, with no special-cased nodes
  (interior = CCHM, leaf = `HealthMonitorable`).
- `CriticalComponentsHealthMonitor` gets simpler — it loses all `ComponentTreeListener`/graph-emission
  responsibility and is a pure children-aggregator.
- The `zeebe_broker_health_nodes` metric **contract changes**: each node is emitted once with
  position-derived `physicalTenant`/`partition` tags; the partition `id`/`path` lose the tenant
  prefix; the `ZeebePartitionHealth-<n>` series is replaced by `DiskSpace` and `PartitionTransition`
  series. The Grafana dashboard (`monitor/grafana/zeebe.json`) and any alerts keyed on the old
  `id`/`path` values must be migrated in lockstep.
- Health is more observable: the reason a partition is unhealthy (disk vs transition vs a specific
  subsystem) is visible as distinct named gauges.
- `ZeebePartitionHealth` and the `ZeebePartition` health-wrapper duplication are deleted; a partition
  contributes exactly one node.
- Broker readiness behaviour is unchanged, including the all-physical-tenants-started invariant.
