/**
 * This class holds the necessary user task data (including variables) to finalize commands such as
 * `COMPLETE`, `UPDATE`, `ASSIGN` etc. mainly when task listeners are defined for these operations.
 *
 * <p>The intermediate state includes a {@link UserTaskRecord} that captures the state of the user
 * task as it was when the command (e.g., COMPLETE, ASSIGN) was invoked. It also tracks the {@link
 * LifecycleState} of the task, representing the current state in its lifecycle (e.g., COMPLETING,
 * ASSIGNING).
 *
 * <p>This state is stored immediately after the user task command is invoked and before the task
 * listeners are executed. It is used to finalize the command after all task listeners have been
 * processed. Once the original command is applied, this state will be removed.
 *
 * <p>This ensures that any data provided with the user task command is persisted and correctly
 * applied after task listener execution when task listeners are defined for the operation.
 *
 * <p>For example, when the user task is being assigned for the first time, the user task must
 * remain unassigned while the task listener blocks the assignment. In the meantime, this
 * intermediate state tracks the new assignee, which can be applied after the task listener
 * completes.
