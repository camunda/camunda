/**
 * This class is used by {@link DbProcessMessageSubscriptionState} and {@link
 * DbMessageSubscriptionState} to keep track of pending (process) message subscriptions. {@link
 * PendingSubscription PendingSubscriptions} are added with a last sent time. The time can be
 * updated with {@link #update(PendingSubscription, long)}. Pending subscriptions are retrieved with
 * {@link #entriesBefore(long)}, ordered by the last sent time. <br>
 * This class is thread safe. It's intended use is that one thread is adding, removing and updating
 * entries while another thread is "observing" the entries by calling {@link #entriesBefore(long)}.
 * <br>
 * The iterable returned by {@link #entriesBefore(long)} may return outdated entries (i.e. entries
 * which last sent time was updated so that those entries should not have been returned) and already
 * removed entries. For the intended use, this is not a problem.
