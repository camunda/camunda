        Creates and starts an instance of the specified process.
        The process definition to use to create the instance can be specified either using its unique key
        (as returned by Deploy resources), or using the BPMN process id and a version.

        Waits for the completion of the process instance before returning a result
        when awaitCompletion is enabled.

            This can happen if the `awaitCompletion` request parameter is set to `true`

            This often happens when the created instance is not fully automated or contains wait states.

        Although the `processInstanceKey` is provided as a path parameter to indicate the root process instance,
        you may also include a `processInstanceKey` within the filter object to narrow results to specific

        subprocesses or called processes under the root instance while excluding incidents directly tied to the root.
