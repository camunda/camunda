    ServiceUnavailable:
      description: >
        The service is currently unavailable. This may happen only on some requests where the system
        creates backpressure to prevent the server's compute resources from being exhausted, avoiding more severe failures.
        In this case, the title of the error object contains `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.
        Clients are recommended to eventually retry those requests after a backoff period.
        You can learn more about the backpressure mechanism here: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/zeebe/technical-concepts/internal-processing/#handling-backpressure .
