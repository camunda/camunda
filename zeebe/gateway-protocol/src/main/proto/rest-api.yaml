        The following attributes can be adjusted with this endpoint, additional attributes
        will be ignored:

        * `candidateGroups` - reset by providing an empty list
        * `candidateUsers` - reset by providing an empty list

        * `followUpDate` - reset by providing an empty String
        * `priority` - minimum 0, maximum 100, default 50

        Providing any of those attributes with a `null` value or omitting it preserves
        the persisted attribute's value.

        The assignee cannot be adjusted with this endpoint, use the Assign task endpoint.
        This ensures correct event emission for assignee changes.

            If set to true, the variables are merged strictly into the local scope (as specified by the `elementInstanceKey`).
            Otherwise, the variables are propagated to upper scopes and set at the outermost one.

            Letâ€™s consider the following example:

            There are two scopes '1' and '2'.
            Scope '1' is the parent scope of '2'. The effective variables of the scopes are:
            1 => { "foo" : 2 }
            2 => { "bar" : 1 }

            An update request with elementInstanceKey as '2', variables { "foo" : 5 }, and local set
            to true leaves scope '1' unchanged and adjusts scope '2' to { "bar" : 1, "foo" 5 }.

            By default, with local set to false, scope '1' will be { "foo": 5 }
            and scope '2' will be { "bar" : 1 }.
          type: boolean
          default: false
