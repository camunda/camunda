      summary: Upload multiple documents
      description: |
        Upload multiple documents to the Camunda 8 cluster.

        The caller must provide a file name for each document, which will be used in case of a multi-status response
        to identify which documents failed to upload. The file name can be provided in the `Content-Disposition` header
        of the file part or in the `fileName` field of the metadata, which can be configured with
        the `X-Document-Metadata` header for each file part. If both are provided, the `fileName` metadata field
        takes precedence. For example, given the following headers for a file:
        ```
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="files"; filename="bill.pdf"
        X-Document-Metadata: {"fileName": "invoice.pdf", "size": 1234567}
        ```

        The filename will be `invoice.pdf`, but in the following example:
        ```
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="files"; filename="bill.pdf"
        X-Document-Metadata: {"size": 1234567}
        ```

        it would be `bill.pdf`.

        In case of a multi-status response, the response body will contain a list of `DocumentBatchProblemDetail` objects,
        each of which contains the file name of the document that failed to upload and the reason for the failure.
        The client can choose to retry the whole batch or individual documents based on the response.

        Note that this is currently supported for document stores of type: AWS, GCP, in-memory (non-production), local (non-production)

            Otherwise, the variables are propagated to upper scopes and set at the outermost one.

            Let’s consider the following example:

            There are two scopes '1' and '2'.
            Scope '1' is the parent scope of '2'. The effective variables of the scopes are:
            1 => { "foo" : 2 }
            2 => { "bar" : 1 }

            An update request with elementInstanceKey as '2', variables { "foo" : 5 }, and local set
            to true leaves scope '1' unchanged and adjusts scope '2' to { "bar" : 1, "foo" 5 }.

            By default, with local set to false, scope '1' will be { "foo": 5 }
            and scope '2' will be { "bar" : 1 }.
