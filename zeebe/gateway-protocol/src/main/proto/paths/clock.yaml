    summary: Pin internal clock (alpha)
    description: |
      Set a precise, static time for the Zeebe engine's internal clock.
      When the clock is pinned, it remains at the specified time and does not advance.
      To change the time, the clock must be pinned again with a new timestamp.

      This endpoint is an alpha feature and may be subject to change
      in future releases.

      Resets the Zeebe engine's internal clock to the current system time, enabling it to tick in real-time.
      This operation is useful for returning the clock to
      normal behavior after it has been pinned to a specific time.
