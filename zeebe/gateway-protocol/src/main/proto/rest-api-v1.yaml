            The following attributes can be adjusted with this endpoint, additional attributes
            will be ignored:

            * `candidateGroups` - reset by providing an empty list
            * `candidateUsers` - reset by providing an empty list
            * `dueDate` - reset by providing an empty String
            * `followUpDate` - reset by providing an empty String
            * `priority` - minimum 0, maximum 100, default 50

            Providing any of those attributes with a `null` value or omitting it preserves
            the persisted attribute's value.

            The assignee cannot be adjusted with this endpoint, use the Assign task endpoint.
            This ensures correct event emission for assignee changes.
