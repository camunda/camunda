# Zeebe standalone gateway configuration file.

# ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
# In order to activate the settings in this file, rename this file to application.yaml
# ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

# For the configuration of the embedded gateway that is deployed alongside a broker see the gateway section of broker.yaml.template

# Overview -------------------------------------------

# This file contains a complete list of available configuration options.

# Conventions:
#
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with KB = Kilobytes, MB = Megabytes or GB = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16MB" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified either in the standard ISO-8601 format used
# by java.time.Duration, or as strings with the following format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 5, 10, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the gateway.

# network:
# Sets the host the gateway binds to
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_GATEWAY_NETWORK_HOST.
# host: 0.0.0.0
#
# Sets the port the gateway binds to
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_GATEWAY_NETWORK_PORT.
# port: 26500
#
# Sets the minimum keep alive interval
# This setting specifies the minimum accepted interval between keep alive pings. This value must
# be specified as a positive integer followed by 's' for seconds, 'm' for minutes or 'h' for hours.
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_GATEWAY_NETWORK_MINKEEPALIVEINTERVAL.

# cluster:
# Sets initial contact points of brokers
# The contact points of the internal network configuration must be specified.
# The format is [HOST:PORT]
# Example:
# initialContactPoints : [ 192.168.1.22:26502, 192.168.1.32:26502 ]
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CLUSTER_INITIALCONTACTPOINTS
# specifying a comma-separated list of contact points.
# Default is 127.0.0.1:26502
# initialContactPoints : [127.0.0.1:26502]

# WARNING: This setting is deprecated! Use initialContactPoints instead.
# Sets the broker the gateway should initial contact
