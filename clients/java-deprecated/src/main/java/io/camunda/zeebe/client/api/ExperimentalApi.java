/**
 * Indicates a public API that can change at any time, and has no guarantee of API stability and
 * backward-compatibility. If users want stabilization or signature change of a specific API that is
 * currently annotated {@code @ExperimentalApi}, please comment on its tracking issue on github with
 * rationale, usecase, and so forth, so that the Zeebe team may prioritize the process toward
 * stabilization of the API.
 *
 * <p>Usage guidelines:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>This annotation is used only on public API. Internal interfaces should not use it.
 *   <li>After Zeebe has gained API stability, this annotation can only be added to new API. Adding
 *       it to an existing API is considered API-breaking.
 *   <li>Removing this annotation from an API gives it stable status.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Note: This annotation is intended only for Zeebe library code. Users should not attach this
 * annotation to their own code.
 *
 * <p>This annotation was originally copied from io.grpc.ExperimentalApi, licensed under the Apache
 * License, Version 2.0. Copyright 2015 The gRPC Authors. Changes have been made since.
