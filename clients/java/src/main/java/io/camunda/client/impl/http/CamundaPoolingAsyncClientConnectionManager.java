/**
 * {@code PoolingAsyncClientConnectionManager} maintains a pool of non-blocking {@link
 * org.apache.hc.core5.http.HttpConnection}s and is able to service connection requests from
 * multiple execution threads. Connections are pooled on a per route basis. A request for a route
 * which already the manager has persistent connections for available in the pool will be services
 * by leasing a connection from the pool rather than creating a new connection.
 *
 * <p>{@code PoolingAsyncClientConnectionManager} maintains a maximum limit of connection on a per
 * route basis and in total. Connection limits can be adjusted using {@link ConnPoolControl}
 * methods.
 *
 * <p>Total time to live (TTL) set at construction time defines maximum life span of persistent
 * connections regardless of their expiration setting. No persistent connection will be re-used past
 * its TTL value.

 * @since 5.0
