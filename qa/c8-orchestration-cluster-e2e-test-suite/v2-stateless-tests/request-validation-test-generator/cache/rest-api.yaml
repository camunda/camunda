        Resolves multiple instances of process instances.
        Since only process instances with ACTIVE state can have unresolved incidents, any given
        filters for state are ignored and overridden during this batch operation.
        This is done asynchronously, the progress can be tracked using the batchOperationKey from the response and the batch operation status endpoint (/batch-operations/{batchOperationKey}).

        latest process improvements.

      description: |
        Upload multiple documents to the Camunda 8 cluster.

        The caller must provide a file name for each document, which will be used in case of a multi-status response
        to identify which documents failed to upload. The file name can be provided in the `Content-Disposition` header
        of the file part or in the `fileName` field of the metadata. You can add a parallel array of metadata objects. These
        are matched with the files based on index, and must have the same length as the files array.
        To pass homogenous metadata for all files, spread the metadata over the metadata array.
        A filename value provided explicitly via the metadata array in the request overrides the `Content-Disposition` header
        of the file part.

        In case of a multi-status response, the response body will contain a list of `DocumentBatchProblemDetail` objects,
        each of which contains the file name of the document that failed to upload and the reason for the failure.
        The client can choose to retry the whole batch or individual documents based on the response.

        Note that this is currently supported for document stores of type: AWS, GCP, in-memory (non-production), local (non-production)

                Defines a list of alternative filter groups combined using OR logic. Each object in the array is evaluated independently, and the filter matches if any one of them is satisfied.

                Top-level fields and the `$or` clause are combined using AND logic — meaning: (top-level filters) AND (any of the `$or` filters) must match.

                Defines a list of alternative filter groups combined using OR logic. Each object in the array is evaluated independently, and the filter matches if any one of them is satisfied.

                Top-level fields and the `$or` clause are combined using AND logic — meaning: (top-level filters) AND (any of the `$or` filters) must match.
                <br>
                <em>Example:</em>

                ```json
                {
                  "state": "ACTIVE",
                  "tenantId": 123,
                  "$or": [

                  ]
                }
                ```
                This matches process instances that:

                  <li style="list-style-type: disc;">are in <em>ACTIVE</em> state</li>

                  <li style="list-style-type: disc;">and match either:

                      <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><code>processDefinitionId</code> is <em>process_v1</em>, or</li>

            Otherwise, the variables are propagated to upper scopes and set at the outermost one.

            Let’s consider the following example:

            There are two scopes '1' and '2'.
            Scope '1' is the parent scope of '2'. The effective variables of the scopes are:
            1 => { "foo" : 2 }
            2 => { "bar" : 1 }

            An update request with elementInstanceKey as '2', variables { "foo" : 5 }, and local set
            to true leaves scope '1' unchanged and adjusts scope '2' to { "bar" : 1, "foo" 5 }.

            By default, with local set to false, scope '1' will be { "foo": 5 }
            and scope '2' will be { "bar" : 1 }.

    ServiceUnavailable:
      description: >
        The service is currently unavailable. This may happen only on some requests where the system
        creates backpressure to prevent the server's compute resources from being exhausted, avoiding more severe failures.
        Clients are recommended to eventually retry those requests after a backoff period.
        You can learn more about the backpressure mechanism here: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/zeebe/technical-concepts/internal-processing/#handling-backpressure .
