## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camunda/camunda.git
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite` directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

---

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside `c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite`.
This file configures test parameters, including application URLs and credentials.
**Note**: Do not commit the `.env` file to GitHub to avoid exposing sensitive information.

Example:

```env
LOCAL_TEST=true
CORE_APPLICATION_URL=http://localhost:8080
CAMUNDA_AUTH_STRATEGY=BASIC
CAMUNDA_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=demo
CAMUNDA_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=demo
ZEEBE_REST_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8080
```

---

### 4. Start Local Camunda 8 Self-Managed Environment

For running tests locally, ensure you have an active instance. To set it up:

1. Open a terminal in the `config` folder inside the `c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite` directory.
2. Run:

```bash
DATABASE=elasticsearch docker compose up -d camunda
```

This launches Tasklist and Operate with Elasticsearch as the backing database.
üõ†Ô∏è Ensure the ports in your .env match those used in this setup (e.g., 8080, 8081, 8089).

## Running Tests Locally

### Headless Mode

To run the tests without a graphical user interface:

```bash
npm run test:local
```

### Interactive Mode (UI)

To run the tests with the UI:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Viewing Local Test Results

After running tests locally, you can view the report:

```bash
npx playwright show-report html-report
```

Reports and artifacts:

- `qa/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite/html-report`: Latest HTML report
- `qa/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite/test-results/`: Traces and screenshots

---

## Test Suite Structure (Page Object Model)

This test suite follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern for reusability and maintainability.

- Page objects: `qa/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite/pages`
- Test specs: `qa/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite/tests`
- Utilities/fixtures: `qa/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite/utils`
- Test data: `qa/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite/resources`

---

## GitHub Actions for Testing

### Running the On-Demand Workflow

- `c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-tests-on-demand.yml`: Manually triggered for ad hoc testing

1. Go to [C8 Orchestration Cluster E2E Tests On Demand](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/actions/workflows/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-tests-on-demand.yml)
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Choose the desired branch (e.g., `main`, `stable/8.6`, `stable/8.7`, `stable/8.8`)
4. Click **"Run workflow"**

---

### Automated Nightly Test Runs

- `c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-tests-nightly.yml`: Runs nightly across all monorepo versions
  Nightly tests ensure continuous stability

- All nightly test runs can be accessed from [C8 Orchestration Cluster E2E Tests Nightly](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/actions/workflows/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-tests-nightly.yml)

- Results posted to Slack channel `#c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-results` with TestRail links

- Failures are reviewed by the `qa-automated-release-manager`

---

### CI Test Results

- Results available under the **Actions** tab for each workflow run
- View logs, traces, and download artifacts
- Test runs are published to [TestRail](https://camunda.testrail.com/index.php?/runs/overview/33) for visibility

---
