[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.camunda/camunda-zeebe/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.camunda/camunda-zeebe)

Camunda 8 delivers scalable, on-demand process automation as a service. Camunda 8 is combined with powerful execution engines for BPMN processes and DMN decisions, and paired with tools for collaborative modeling, operations, and analytics.

This repository contains the [Orchestration cluster](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/components/orchestration-cluster/) components of Camunda 8 and Optimize:

* [Zeebe](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/zeebe/zeebe-overview/) - The cloud-native process engine of Camunda 8.
* [Tasklist](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/tasklist/introduction-to-tasklist/) - Complete tasks that require human input.
* [Operate](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/operate/operate-introduction/) - Manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your processes.
* [Identity](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/components/identity/identity-introduction/) - Manage integrated authentication and authorization.
* [Optimize](https://docs.camunda.io/optimize/components/what-is-optimize/) - Improve your processes by identifying constraints in your system.

In addition, the Camunda 8 stack also includes:
* [Console](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/console/introduction-to-console/) - Configure and deploy clusters with Console.
* [Web Modeler](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/about-modeler/) - Web Application to model BPMN, DMN, & Forms and deploy or start new instances.
* [Desktop Modeler](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/desktop-modeler/) - Use Desktop Modeler as a desktop application for modeling BPMN, DMN, and Forms with your local process application project.
* [Connectors](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/introduction-to-connectors/) - Integrate with an external system by using a Connector.
* [Management Identity](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/identity/what-is-identity/) - Manage authentication, access, and authorization for components outside the Orchestration cluster (Console, Web Modeler, and Optimize)

Using Camunda 8, you can:

* Define processes visually in [BPMN 2.0](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/)
* Choose your programming language
* Deploy with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* Build processes that react to messages from [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and other message queues
* Scale horizontally to handle very high throughput
* Fault tolerance (no relational database required)
* Export process data for monitoring and analysis
* Engage with an active community
