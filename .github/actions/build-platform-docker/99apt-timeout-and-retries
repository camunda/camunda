// The purpose of this APT configuration file is to make Docker image builds
// more resilient against package mirror or network problems.
// The file can be copied into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ during the build process.
// The default APT retries value is 3, so doubling it gives more chance for a successfull build.
