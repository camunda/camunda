## Introduction

<!-- Provide a short summary about the problem this Epic will solve -->

## Concept

<!-- Provide a high-level explanation of the implementation concept. For example, when a new BPMN element gets added,
explain how it is supposed to work. -->

## Task Breakdown

<!-- When splitting the Epic into smaller issues, they should be referenced here. This provides an
easy overview of all that needs to happen. It also provides a good overview of the progress on the
Epic thus far. -->

### Broker

<!-- Tasks that require changes in the Broker -->

### Gateway API

<!-- Tasks that require changes to the Gateway API. This also includes changes in the clients -->

### Exporters and Metrics

<!-- Tasks that require changes to the exporters and metrics -->

### Testing

<!-- Tasks for extending the tests. This does not include unit tests, these should be written as
part of any other task. Think about things like QA tests and the randomized property tests -->

### Zeebe Process Test

Gateway API, a change needs to be made in Zeebe Process Test as well. -->

### Out of scope
