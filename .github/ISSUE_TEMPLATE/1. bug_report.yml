        Does this bug impact an automated test suite? If so:

        **For the Cross Component Test Suite:**
        This issue breaks a test case in the Cross Component Test Suite [Add link to the respective test case here]. Before you consider the fix as done, please check if the respective test case passes. To trigger the full test suite, follow the directions here: [GitHub Actions for Testing](https://github.com/camunda/c8-cross-component-e2e-tests/blob/main/README.md#github-actions-for-testing).

        **For the Orchestration Cluster Test Suite:**
        This issue breaks a test case in the C8 Orchestration Cluster Test Suite [Add link to the respective test case here]. The test suite can be triggered automatically via PRs.

        Note: PR-triggered test runs only cover the components affected by the PR. Cross-component flows, or flows involving other components, are executed only during nightly builds and release runs. To trigger the full test suite, follow the directions here: [GitHub Actions for Testing](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/main/qa/c8-orchestration-cluster-e2e-test-suite/README.md#running-the-on-demand-workflow).

        **General note:**
        The automated test cases on E2E level might not provide enough test coverage to verify if the fix works 100%. Ensure the fix is covered by a sufficient regression test. Conduct manual testing if required. Until this bug is fixed, the affected test will be skipped. Once the fix passes, create a PR in the respective test suite to re-enable the test.
