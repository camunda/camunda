# description: This workflow runs our daily scheduled acceptance tests. It runs each test suite against the
# development head (e.g. main) and all officially supported branches (e.g. `stable/8.8`).
#
# As this is meant to be run via scheduling, the workflow itself only runs on the default branch
# (e.g. main), so any changes you make will affect any other branches we test via this workflow.
