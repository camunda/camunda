# This workflow automatically inherits the 'Project Name' and 'Team' fields from a parent sub-issue
# if the parent is in Project 173 (Core Features only). It ensures that sub-issues are correctly
# associated with the same project and team as their parent, maintaining project consistency.
#
# The workflow triggers on issue creation or edit events, checks for a parent sub-issue relationship,
# and, if found, copies the relevant fields from the parent to the child issue in the GitHub project.
