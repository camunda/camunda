# This workflow ensures that pull requests aren't updated using merge commits.
# To update a pull request with the latest changes you should rebase your branch on the base branch.
# See our contributing guide's section on 'Creating a pull request' for more information:
# https://github.com/camunda/camunda/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-a-pull-request
#
# It is allowed to have merge commits in a pull request.
# An example is a pull request that builds upon the work of another pull request.
