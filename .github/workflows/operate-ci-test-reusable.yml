# This GitHub Actions workflow automates the CI test process for the 'operate' service.
# It triggers on a `workflow_call` event and accepts inputs for branch name[required] and fork count[optional]
#
# It consists of a several steps:
# 1. Setup: It checks out the specified branch, sets up Java and Maven with the provided inputs, and imports secrets from Vault.
# 2. Tests: Runs unit and integration tests.
# 3. Reports: Publishes the test results, even if some steps failed.
#
# Environment variables are used to control CPU limits.
# This workflow is designed to provide a comprehensive, automated CI process that ensures code quality, handles secrets securely,
# and enables detailed reporting of test results.

# CI IT test reusable GitHub Actions Workflow
# Triggers on a workflow_call event and accepts inputs for branch name and fork count
# Performs integration tests for the tasklist service with parallel execution.
