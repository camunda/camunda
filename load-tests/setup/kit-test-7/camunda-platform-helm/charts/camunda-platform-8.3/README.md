    src="../../imgs/camunda-platform-8-self-managed-architecture-diagram-combined-ingress.png"
    width="80%"
  />
</p>

## Requirements

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) >= 3.9.x
* Kubernetes >= 1.20+
* Minimum cluster requirements include the following to run this chart with default settings.
  All of these settings are configurable.
  * Three Kubernetes nodes to respect the default "hard" affinity settings
  * 2GB of RAM for the JVM heap

## Dependencies

Camunda 8 Helm chart is an umbrella chart for different components. Some are internal (sub-charts),
and some are external (third-party). The dependency management is fully automated and managed by Helm itself;
however, it's good to understand the dependency structure. This third-party dependency is reflected in the Helm chart
as follows:

```
camunda-platform
  |_ elasticsearch
  |_ identity
    |_ keycloak
      |_ postgresql
  |_ optimize
  |_ operate
  |_ tasklist
  |_ zeebe
  |_ postgresql
```

> :bulb: Please note that the Connectors and Web Modeler components are part of the main chart and not implemented as sub-charts.

For example, Camunda Identity utilizes Keycloak and allows you to manage users, roles, and permissions
for Camunda 8 components.

- Keycloak is a dependency for Camunda Identity, and PostgreSQL is a dependency for Keycloak.
- Elasticsearch is a dependency for the Camunda chart, which is used in Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Optimize.
- PostgreSQL is an optional dependency for the Camunda chart and is used by Web Modeler.

The values for the dependencies Keycloak and PostgreSQL can be set in the same hierarchy:

```yaml
identity:
  [identity values]
  keycloak:
    [keycloak values]
    postgresql:
      [postgresql values]
postgresql:
  [postgresql values]
```

## Versioning

### After July 2023

Starting from July 2023 (v8.2.8), the Camunda 8 **Helm chart** version follows the same unified schema
and schedule as [Camunda 8 applications](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform).

Hence, if the Camunda 8 unified **applications** version is `8.2.8`, the Camunda 8 **Helm chart**
will also be `8.2.8`.

### Before July 2023

Camunda 8 **Helm chart** versions are only aligned with the minor version of
[Camunda 8](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform). In other words, the `Camunda 8 Helm chart`
could have a different patch version than the `Camunda` Platform 8 Applications`.

For example, the Camunda 8 **Helm chart** could be on version `8.1.1`, but Camunda 8 **applications**
are on version `8.1.0`. Additionally, the Camunda 8 **Helm chart** could be on version `8.1.1`,
but Camunda 8 **applications** are on version `8.1.2`.

### Compatibility Matrix

The core Camunda applications have a unified fixed release schedule (minor release twice a year and patch release
every month). However, some of the applications have their own schedule. The following compatibility matrix gives
an overview of the different versions.

| Release Cycle | Helm chart | Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist | Optimize | Web Modeler  | Connectors |
| ---           | ---        | ---                      | ---      | ---          | ---        |
| Apr 2023      | 8.2.x      | 8.2.x                    | 3.10.x   | 8.2.x        | >= 0.18.0  |
| Oct 2022      | 8.1.x      | 8.1.x                    | 3.9.x    | N/A          | N/A        |
| Apr 2022      | 8.0.x      | 8.0.x                    | 3.9.x    | N/A          | N/A        |

## Installation

The first command adds the official Camunda Helm charts repo, and the second installs the Camunda
chart to your current Kubernetes context.

```shell
helm repo add camunda https://helm.camunda.io
helm install camunda-platform camunda/camunda-platform
```

Although the Camunda 8 Helm chart gets the latest version of Camunda 8 applications,
the version is still possible to diverge slightly between the chart and the apps
(more details about that can be found in [versioning](../../README.md#versioning)).

To have the latest version of the chart and apps at any time, install the chart as follows:

```shell
helm install camunda-platform camunda/camunda-platform \
    --values https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/values/values-latest.yaml
```

For previous version, you can get the latest applications patch version using our [backporting mechanism](#backporting).

### Local Kubernetes

We recommend using Helm on KIND for local environments, as the Helm configurations are battle-tested
and much closer to production systems.

For more details, follow the Camunda 8
[local Kubernetes cluster guide](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/local-kubernetes-cluster/).

### OpenShift

Check out [OpenShift Support](openshift/README.md) to get started with deploying the charts on Red Hat OpenShift. 

## Backporting

Our Helm chart is highly customizable and constantly evolving.
Hence, currently, we backport the older charts by providing extra values file per version.
That covers most backporting cases, like updating the application's image tags to the latest patch
version, setting env var, etc.

To install a previous chart version with the latest apps patch image tags for that version,
use the values file for the minor release. For example (the values file could also be downloaded):

```shell
helm install camunda-platform camunda/camunda-platform --version 8.1 \
    --values https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/values/values-v8.1.yaml
```

## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:

```sh
helm uninstall YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

> **Note**
>
> Notice that all the Services and Pods will be deleted, but not the PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
> which are used to hold the storage for the data generated by the cluster and Elasticsearch.

To free up the storage, you need to delete all the PVCs manually.

First, view the PVCs:

```sh
kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
kubectl get pvc -l release=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

Then delete the ones that you don't want to keep:

```sh
kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
kubectl delete pvc -l release=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

Or you can delete the related Kubernetes namespace, which contains all PVCs.

## Configuration

The following sections contain the configuration values for the chart and each sub-chart. All of them can be overwritten
via a separate `values.yaml` file.

Check out the default [values.yaml](values.yaml) file, which contains the same content and documentation.

> **Note**
> For more details about deploying Camunda 8 on Kubernetes, please visit the
> [Helm/Kubernetes installation instructions docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/overview/).

## Notes on Configuration

### Web Modeler

> :information_source: Web Modeler Self-Managed is available to Camunda enterprise customers only.

#### Docker registry
The Docker images for Web Modeler are available in a private registry.
Enterprise customers either already have credentials to this registry, or they can request access to this registry through their CSM contact at Camunda.
To enable Kubernetes to pull the images from Camunda's registry, you'll need to:
- [create an image pull secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod) using the provided credentials
- configure the Web Modeler pods to use the secret:
  ```yaml
  webModeler:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
        - name: <MY_SECRET_NAME>
   ```

#### Database
Web Modeler requires a PostgreSQL database to store the data.
You can either:
- deploy a PostgreSQL instance as part of the Helm release by setting `postgresql.enabled` to `true` (which will enable the [`postgresql` chart dependency](#postgresql-for-web-modeler))
- configure a connection to an (existing) external database by setting `postgresql.enabled` to `false` and providing the values under `restapi.externalDatabase`

#### SMTP server
Web Modeler requires an SMTP server to send (notification) emails to users.
The SMTP connection can be configured with the values under `restapi.mail`.

#### Updating Environment Variables
When configuring the `env` options in the settings listed above, the environment variables you specify in values.yaml may show up twice when running `kubectl describe deployment <deployment>`. However, the environment variable specified in values.yaml will have precedence when the pod actually runs. To verify this, you can check the output from the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec pod/<podName> -- env
```

#### Outbound Connectors

To learn more about outbound connectors, visit [related documentation article](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/#outbound-connector).

#### Inbound Connectors

To learn more about inbound connectors, visit [related documentation article](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/#inbound-connector).

#### Using Connector Secrets

Connector secrets are generally configured via environment variables.

You can set them via `values.yaml`, or command line. For example, if you need to set a Slack token, you should configure the following:

```yaml
connectors:
  env:
    - name: SLACK_TOKEN
      value: <your actual token value>
```

After that, a Modeler user can set in their BPMN diagram a value `secrets.SLACK_TOKEN` without ever knowing the actual token.

Visit [using secrets in manual installation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/8.0/self-managed/connectors-deployment/connectors-configuration/#secrets-in-manual-installations) to learn more.

### Elasticsearch

Camunda 8 Helm chart has a dependency on the [Elasticsearch 8 Helm Chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/elasticsearch). All variables related to Elasticsearch can be set under `elasticsearch`.

> **Note**
>
> The default setup of the Elasticsearch 8 part of Camunda 8 uses nodes have all roles (master, data, coordinating, and ingest).
> For high-demand deployments, it's recommended to deploy the Elasticsearch master-elegible nodes as master-only nodes.

| Section | Parameter | Description | Default |
|-|-|-|-|
| `elasticsearch`| `enabled` | If true, enables Elasticsearch deployment as part of the Camunda Helm chart | `true` |

**Example:**

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  enabled: true
  image:
    tag: <YOUR_VERSION_HERE>
```

#### Elasticsearch Retention

Since moving to Elasticsearch 8, [Curator](https://github.com/elastic/curator) is deprecated in favor of [Manage the index lifecycle](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html) (ILM). Hence, each component in Camunda 8 controls its Elasticsearch index retention.

### Keycloak

When Camunda 8 Identity component is enabled by default, and it depends on
[Bitnami Keycloak chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/keycloak).
Since Keycloak is a dependency for Identity, all variables related to Keycloak can be found in
[bitnami/keycloak/values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/keycloak/values.yaml)
and can be set under `identity.keycloak`.

| Section | Parameter | Description | Default |
|-|-|-|-|
| `identity.keycloak`| `enabled` | If true, enables Keycloak chart deployment as part of the Camunda Helm chart | `true` |

**Example:**

```yaml
identity:
  keycloak:
    enabled: true
```

#### Keycloak Theme

Camunda provides a custom theme for the login page used in all apps. The theme is copied from the Identity image.

The theme is added to Keycloak by default, however, since Helm v3 (the latest checked 3.10.x) doesn't merge lists
with custom values files, then you will need to add this to your own values file if you override any of
`extraVolumes`, `initContainers`, or `extraVolumeMounts`.

```yaml
identity:
  keycloak:
    extraVolumes:
    - name: camunda-theme
      emptyDir:
        sizeLimit: 10Mi
    initContainers:
    - name: copy-camunda-theme
      image: >-
        {{- $identityImageParams := (dict "base" .Values.global "overlay" .Values.global.identity) -}}
        {{- include "camundaPlatform.imageByParams" $identityImageParams }}
      imagePullPolicy: "{{ .Values.global.image.pullPolicy }}"
      command: ["sh", "-c", "cp -a /app/keycloak-theme/* /mnt"]
      volumeMounts:
      - name: camunda-theme
        mountPath: /mnt
    extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: camunda-theme
      mountPath: /opt/bitnami/keycloak/themes/identity
```

## Development

For development purposes, you might want to deploy and test the charts without creating a new helm chart release.
To do this you can run the following:

```sh
 helm install YOUR_RELEASE_NAME --atomic --debug ./charts/camunda-platform
```

 * `--atomic if set, the installation process deletes the installation on failure. The --wait flag will be set automatically if --atomic is used`

 * `--debug enable verbose output`

To generate the resources/manifests without really installing them, you can use: 

 * `--dry-run simulate an install`

If you see errors like:

```sh
Error: found in Chart.yaml, but missing in charts/ directory: elasticsearch
```

Then you need to download the dependencies first.

Run the following to add resolve the dependencies:

```sh
make helm.repos-add
```

After this, you can run: `make helm.dependency-update`, which will update and download the dependencies for all charts.

The execution should look like this:
```
$ make helm.dependency-update
helm dependency update charts/camunda-platform
