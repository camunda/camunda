## Architecture

See [Camunda 8 reference architectures](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/self-managed/reference-architecture/)

## Requirements

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) >= 3.9.x
- Kubernetes >= 1.20+
- Minimum cluster requirements include the following to run this chart with default settings.
  - All of these settings are configurable.
  - Three Kubernetes nodes to respect the default "hard" affinity settings
  - 2GB of RAM for the JVM heap

## Dependencies

Camunda 8 Helm chart is an umbrella chart for different components. Some are internal (sub-charts),
and some are external (third-party). The dependency management is fully automated and managed by Helm itself;
however, it's good to understand the dependency structure. This third-party dependency is reflected in the Helm chart
as follows:

```text
camunda-platform
  |_ elasticsearch
  |_ identity
    |_ keycloak
      |_ postgresql
  |_ optimize
  |_ operate
  |_ tasklist
  |_ zeebe
  |_ postgresql
```

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the Connectors and Web Modeler components are part of the main chart and not implemented as sub-charts.

For example, Camunda Identity utilizes Keycloak and allows you to manage users, roles, and permissions
for Camunda 8 components.

- Keycloak is a dependency for Camunda Identity, and PostgreSQL is a dependency for Keycloak.
- Elasticsearch is a dependency for the Camunda chart, which is used in Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Optimize.
- PostgreSQL is an optional dependency for the Camunda chart and is used by Web Modeler.

The values for the dependencies Keycloak and PostgreSQL can be set in the same hierarchy:

```yaml
identity:
  [identity values]
  keycloak:
    [keycloak values]
    postgresql:
      [postgresql values]
postgresql:
  [postgresql values]
```

## Versioning

After the 8.4 release (January 2024), the Camunda Helm chart version is **decoupled** from the version of the application (e.g., the chart version is `9.0.0` and the application version is `8.4.x`).

Before the 8.4 release, the Camunda Helm chart version was **coupled** with the applications version (e.g., chart version is `8.3.x` and applications version is `8.3.x`).

For more details, check out the [full version matrix](https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/version-matrix).

## Installation

The first command adds the official Camunda Helm charts repo, and the second installs the Camunda
chart to your current Kubernetes context.

```shell
helm repo add camunda https://helm.camunda.io
helm install camunda-platform camunda/camunda-platform
```

Although the Camunda 8 Helm chart gets the latest version of Camunda 8 applications,
the version is still possible to diverge slightly between the chart and the apps
(more details about that can be found in [versioning](../../README.md#versioning)).

To have the latest version of the chart and apps at any time, install the chart as follows:

```shell
helm install camunda-platform camunda/camunda-platform \
    --values https://helm.camunda.io/camunda-platform/values/values-latest.yaml
```

For the previous version, you can get the latest applications patch version using our [backporting mechanism](#backporting).

### Local Kubernetes

We recommend using Helm on KIND for local environments, as the Helm configurations are battle-tested
and much closer to production systems.

For more details, follow the Camunda 8
[local Kubernetes cluster guide](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/local-kubernetes-cluster/).

## Camunda 8 Helm Chart (Autogenerated)

This file is intentionally minimal. The detailed README content for chart `camunda-platform-8.8` is auto-generated from `values.yaml` / `values.schema.json` by the CI pipeline and will replace this placeholder on the next generation step.

Reason: merge conflict cleanup while preserving secret refactor & orchestration rename.

To regenerate locally (developer convenience only):

```
make docs.values-readme chart=camunda-platform-8.8
```

Avoid manual edits; they will be lost.

<!-- AUTOGENERATED PLACEHOLDER -->

The following sections contain the configuration values for the chart and each sub-chart. All of them can be overwritten
via a separate `values.yaml` file.

Check out the default [values.yaml](values.yaml) file, which contains the same content and documentation.

> [!NOTE]

> For more details about deploying Camunda 8 on Kubernetes, please visit the
> [Helm/Kubernetes installation instructions docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/overview/).

## Notes on Configuration

### Web Modeler

> [!NOTE]
>
> Non-production installations of Web Modeler are restricted to five collaborators per project. Refer to [the documentation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/reference/licenses/) for more information.

#### Database

Web Modeler requires a PostgreSQL database to store the data.
You can either:

- Deploy a PostgreSQL instance as part of the Helm release by setting `postgresql.enabled` to `true` (which will enable the [postgresql chart dependency](#webmodeler---postgresql-parameters)).
- Configure a connection to an (existing) external database by setting `postgresql.enabled` to `false` and providing the values under `restapi.externalDatabase`.

#### SMTP server

Web Modeler requires an SMTP server to send (notification) emails to users.
The SMTP connection can be configured with the values under `restapi.mail`.

#### Updating Environment Variables

When configuring the `env` options in the settings listed above, the environment variables you specify in values.yaml may show up twice when running `kubectl describe deployment <deployment>`. However, the environment variable is specified in values.yaml will have precedence when the pod actually runs. To verify this, you can check the output from the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec pod/<podName> -- env
```

#### Outbound Connectors

To learn more about outbound connectors, visit [related documentation article](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/#outbound-connector).

#### Inbound Connectors

To learn more about inbound connectors, visit [related documentation article](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/#inbound-connector).

#### Using Connector Secrets

Connector secrets are generally configured via environment variables.

You can set them via `values.yaml`, or command line. For example, if you need to set a Slack token, you should configure the following:

```yaml
connectors:
  env:
    - name: SLACK_TOKEN
      value: <your actual token value>
```

After that, a Modeler user can set in their BPMN diagram a value `secrets.SLACK_TOKEN` without ever knowing the actual token.

Visit [using secrets in manual installation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/8.0/self-managed/connectors-deployment/connectors-configuration/#secrets-in-manual-installations) to learn more.

### Elasticsearch

Camunda 8 Helm chart has a dependency on the [Elasticsearch 8 Helm Chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/elasticsearch). All variables related to Elasticsearch can be set under `elasticsearch`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The default setup of the Elasticsearch 8 part of Camunda 8 uses nodes that have all roles (master, data, coordinating, and ingest).
> For high-demand deployments, it's recommended to deploy the Elasticsearch master-eligible nodes as master-only nodes.

| Section         | Parameter | Description                                                                 | Default |
| --------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `elasticsearch` | `enabled` | If true, enables Elasticsearch deployment as part of the Camunda Helm chart | `true`  |

**Example:**

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  enabled: true
  image:
    tag: <YOUR_VERSION_HERE>
```

#### Elasticsearch Retention

Since moving to Elasticsearch 8, [Curator](https://github.com/elastic/curator) is deprecated in favor of [Manage the index lifecycle](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html) (ILM). Hence, each component in Camunda 8 controls its Elasticsearch index retention.

### Keycloak

When Camunda 8 Identity component is enabled by default, and it depends on
[Bitnami Keycloak chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/keycloak).
Since Keycloak is a dependency for Identity, all variables related to Keycloak can be found in
[bitnami/keycloak/values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/keycloak/values.yaml)
and can be set under `identityKeycloak`.

| Section            | Parameter | Description                                                                  | Default |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `identityKeycloak` | `enabled` | If true, enables Keycloak chart deployment as part of the Camunda Helm chart | `true`  |

**Example:**

```yaml
identityKeycloak:
  enabled: true
```

#### Keycloak Theme

Camunda provides a custom theme for the login page used in all apps. The theme is copied from the Identity image.

The theme is added to Keycloak by default, however, since Helm v3 (the latest checked 3.10.x) doesn't merge lists
with custom values files, then you will need to add this to your own values file if you override any of
`extraVolumes`, `initContainers`, or `extraVolumeMounts`.

```yaml
identity:
  keycloak:
    extraVolumes:
      - name: camunda-theme
        emptyDir:
          sizeLimit: 10Mi
    initContainers:
      - name: copy-camunda-theme
        image: >-
          {{- $identityImageParams := (dict "base" .Values.global "overlay" .Values.global.identity) -}}
          {{- include "camundaPlatform.imageByParams" $identityImageParams }}
        imagePullPolicy: "{{ .Values.global.image.pullPolicy }}"
        command: ["sh", "-c", "cp -a /app/keycloak-theme/* /mnt"]
        volumeMounts:
          - name: camunda-theme
            mountPath: /mnt
    extraVolumeMounts:
      - name: camunda-theme
        mountPath: /opt/bitnami/keycloak/themes/identity
```

## Development

For development purposes, you might want to deploy and test the charts without creating a new helm chart release.
To do this you can run the following:

```sh
 helm install camunda --atomic --debug ./charts/camunda-platform
```

- `--atomic if set, the installation process deletes the installation on failure. The --wait flag will be set automatically if --atomic is used`

- `--debug enable verbose output`

To generate the resources/manifests without really installing them, you can use:

- `--dry-run simulate an install`

If you see errors like:

```sh
Error: found in Chart.yaml, but missing in charts/ directory: elasticsearch
```

Then you need to download the dependencies first.

Run the following to add resolve the dependencies:

```sh
make helm.repos-add
```

After this, you can run: `make helm.dependency-update`, which will update and download the dependencies for all charts.

The execution should look like this:

```text
$ make helm.dependency-update
helm dependency update charts/camunda-platform
