##
# This is a minimal values file that is compatible with Helm versions >= 3.2.0. To circumvent the following bug in Helm,
# https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/9136, we use the pattern '@@null@@' which will be replaced via a post-renderer by
# an actual null value. This is hopefully a temporary workaround until the issue is fixed.
#
# To use this, you will need its companion bash script, patch.sh. That is to say, this file is only usable if you use
# the bundled "patch.sh" script post-renderer.
#
# When you have both files, you would simply call:
#   $ helm install test camunda/camunda-platform --post-renderer openshift/patch.sh -f openshift/values-patch.yaml
#
# Refer to the sibling README for more about this and the other possible ways of installing the chart on OpenShift.
