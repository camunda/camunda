# NOTE:
# - This secret object is NOT managed with corresponding releases and NOR part of Helm deployment/upgrade!
#   It's generated once, and if it's deleted, you will lose the secrets.
# - This file is only for auto-generated secrets within the chart; don't add secrets for external resources.
# - The Camunda Helm chart "existingSecret" syntax will be changed in the Camunda 8.8 releases.
